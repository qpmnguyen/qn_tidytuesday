# Tidy Tuesday Submission 
# Quang Nguyen  

This is the repo for all my tidy Tuesday submissions. Files are named as `<dataset_name>_mmddyyyy`. Since I use `renv` to ensure all package versions are good, the state of the library can be restored by the command `renv::restore()`.  

Code is commented with my thought process. Let me know in issues if there are any questions!
